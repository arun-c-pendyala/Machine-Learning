# Project 3 Classification

## Handwritten Digits Recognition using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks

This project is to implement and evaluate classification algorithms on MNIST Dataset and USPS Dataset. 

The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.This is available at:
